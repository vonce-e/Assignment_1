This website intended user audience is for Keyboard enthusiasts/people who want to get into keyboard building.
The hobby of keyboard building is traditionally extremely tedious, as keyboard enthusiasts generally have to
source out each individual part from multiple different websites/shops. This website solves that issue by creating a
place where keyboard enthusiasts like myself can easily get whatever parts they need, all from one website.
